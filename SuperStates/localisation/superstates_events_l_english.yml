Timber, fur, and other goods cost merchantmen much money to transport over long distances to the ports along the Atlantic. Thus, water transit was usually the preferred method, but rivers could not be expected to travel exactly the way businesses wanted them to. Sometimes, canals would be dug to connect two rivers together, or to create a passage to the sea. Such was the case of the Middlesex Canal. Built in 1803, it was the first great civil engineering project in the USA, and would become a subject of study for future canal projects. The canal was designed to connect Boston to the Merrimack river, which was a major trade highway. The construction of the canal would see the inventions of a crude dump truck, watertight locks. The canal's construction, while expensive, was very successful, and remained so until replaced by the railroad.

In a tense but heated moment, Tutt approached the table Hickok was sitting at and demanded an outstanding debt of 40 dollars and a gambling debt of 35 dollars.  Hickok balked stating he has a memorandum stating he honestly only owes him only 25 dollars for the gambling debt.  In the ensuing argument over the remaining 10 dollars seized Hickok's prized pocket watch and humiliated him with little recourse.  Hickok then reminded Tutt and most of the witnesses not to catch Tutt in the square with his pocket watch.\n\nAfter an uneventful night the two men eventually found themselves the next day at about noon in the main street through the square and with further exchange of words the two men fire shots at one another at the exact same time.

Although not proven by any documented source, the story goes that Plummer's wealth and power began in the California Gold Rush, which led him to become town sheriff. But in 1857, a duel ensued. The fight was over an enraged husband who accused Plummer of cheating on his wife, but Plummer won the duel. Convicted of murder, sentenced to prison, he was released 6 months later due to public support. Soon after, Plummer killed a man after a brawl broke out. Arrested, and thrown in jail, he bribed the guard, and fled to Oregon. On his way, he joined forces with Jim Mayfield, a bandit, believed to have murdered a sheriff in a nearby town. Plummer dispatched a message to California that he, and Mayfield were hung in Washington. The media published the story, and law stopped looking for the men. Meanwhile, Plummer's forces grew to a gang. Plummer and his gang robbed families, and caravans carrying gold. But after a string of bad luck, Plummer gave up, and began heading home. But about halfway there, Gold Fever bit him and drove him to prospect for more wealth in the town of Bannack, Montana. Full of Civil War deserters, river pirates, and sorts of vile people of the nation, it was easy for Plummer to form a new gang, this one called 'The Innocents.' Plummer's gang grew, an grew, increasing lawlessness and terror among the citizens of the town. They held an election for sheriff, which a local butcher and Plummer both participated in. The butcher won by a landslide, and in a hasty act of revenge, Plummer attempted to kill the new sheriff with a shotgun, but was shot himself in the arm by the sheriff. Retreating back to safe lines, he began to practice shooting with his other hand. The sheriff resigned, and fled town. In a new election for the town's sheriff, Plummer won, and appointed his top two thugs as his henchmen. Over the course of the next few months, 100 citizens were slain. Because his gang operated so perfectly, he was able to kill and/or silence anyone who could speak against him. Soon, his lust for power would drive him to become Deputy US Marshall for the entire region east of the mountains in Idaho Territory. Angered, and furious, the townspeople of Virginia City, Nevada City, and Bannack formed a militia to put down 'The Innocents.' One by one, the gang was weeded out, until one man about to be hung claimed Plummer was the ringleader. Based on this one accusation alone, the militia brutally executed Plummer without trial or jury. No written evidence is recorded of Plummer doing evil."

The Sioux resisted handing over the perpetrator, so the regiment returned to the fort, and prepared for battle. Upon return to the Sioux, further talks were futile, and the negotiation party returned to the regiment standing by. Suddenly, all Hell broke loose when a nervous soldier discharged his weapon, hitting a Sioux. The Sioux struck down the regiment, even the men who were clearly unarmed. They they proceeded to attack Fort Laramie, but quickly retreated, then looted the trading post. When word of this reached Washington, a large task force sent to dole out justice upon the Sioux, which would be led by Col. Harney.

The Old Man of the Mountain would become New Hampshire's state emblem, license plate, state route signs, and even made it on US Currency as a Statehood Quarter. Alas, New Hampshire's icon came to a bitter end on a cold, snowy night, when it broke away from the cliff face smashing to dust at the bottom.

Their orders were to disarm the populace, due to several near-uprisings which were making the settlers and military uncomfortable. 38 rifles were initially confiscated, with more being taken from searches conducted on the Indians themselves. All went well until they came to a man named Yellow Bird. Yellow Bird became agitated, and refused to give up his rifle. Several other Indians shouted that Yellow Bird was deaf, which did not help tensions. Two soldiers seized Yellow Bird from behind, and in an instant, his rifle discharged. Immediately, Yellow Bird threw dust into the air, and 5 young Indian men fired into the 7th. Now there was no turning the clock back. In a few moments, half the camp of Indians would be dead, or dying. Some Indians fled, others grabbed weapons and engaged the American Army. It soon become clear the Indians would be defeated. Officers lost control of the men, who began firing at women and children who had taken refuge in a small ditch outside the camp. Over 300 Indians would be dead by day's end. Major Forsythe, who was in charge of the outfit, was dismissed by his superior officer, but reinstated by Washington, and went on to become a major general.

 flavorTNN.1t:0 "Scopes 'Monkey' Trial"
 flavorTNN.1d:0 "It all began as just a simple courtroom in a backwoods town of Tennessee. The case? If John Scopes, a high school teacher, had taught evolution in his classroom. If he did, then he had violated a newly incorporated law in Tennessee which forbade the teaching of evolution. The ACLU, who had been opposed to the state's law, in conjunction with George Rappelya who was a miner from Dayton, convinced Scopes to plead guilty in order to challenge the law. Lawyers Clarence Darrow, and William Jennings Bryan came to the case to represent the two parties. Bryan, former secretary of state, had not practiced law for 30 years, but was still active as an author, and a spokesman for fundamentalism. Darrow had just finished a case in Chicago, where he was able to prevent two murderers from receiving the death penalty by reason of insanity. Darrow, and Bryan were both outspoken, but Bryan in religious matters, and Darrow in agnosticism. The media failed to remain unbalanced, calling Bryan a symbol of narrowmindedness, and tribalism, while promoting Darrow as tolerant, and clear-headed. As the trial progressed, it would soon become clear that this was not a matter of whether Scopes broke the law or not, but became a matter of whether the religious and the scientific were unified, or divided. Darrow pressed Bryan on the stand with a battery of tough questions concerning the origin of life, and mankind. However, before Bryan was permitted to question Darrow, Scopes pleaded guilty, which meant Bryan was never able to launch an offensive against Bryan. The significance of this, is that many people were listening to this event over the radio. Many people were swayed by Darrow's perspective, but were never given the option of hearing Bryan's point of view. But who truly has the correct point of view? This event shaped the people of Tennessee, and many other states' world view, with its legacy still ringing out to this day."

 #####Flavor for Virginia/Northern Virginia
 flavorVIR.1t:0 "The Richmond Calamity"
 flavorVIR.1d:0 "On April 27th, 1870, the court-room on the second story of the Capitol building collapsed onto the floor below, killing 50 people, and gravely injuring 100 more. The building was originally constructed as a simple one story complex. But increasing administration meant a second story would have to be added. As the second floor was being built, the architect rested the floor beams on a narrow ledge just a few inches across. The ledge was never meant to support the weight of a second story, but even still, they would probably have resisted the load. But several years after the upgrade, improvements to the building's appearance were desired, and thus, the central pillars were removed. The floor beams supporting the second story had only the ledges to rest on which were already past their safe limits. Over the course of the next several years, the floor sagged, meaning even more load was being put on the middle part of the floor, snowballing the condition. It was just past 11:00 in the morning on that fateful April day when hundreds of people packed on to the second floor. The clerk entered the courtroom, placing his books on the table. One judge was already seated, with his associates still in the conference room. From the media, to the spectators, to the counsel, all were having a merry time, enjoying each other's company in friendly conversation. Suddenly, without rhyme, without warning, a major floorboard running underneath the courtroom broke away, causing the load to cascade to other supports, breaking them as well. In a heart-beat, the second story collapsed into the second sending its screaming occupants with it. Most people survived the incident, no doubt to the quick response from rescue teams. Greater loss of life could have happened if the Hall of Delegates below the courtroom was in session. The day after the disaster, most of the dead would be buried, and the day would be dedicated to mourning, and prayer."

 flavorWVA.1d:0 "Between 1912 and 1921, work conditions in coal mines dropped to such a low level, that large groups of workers threatened to strike if their demands for safety, and better pay were not met. Instead, they were met with the barrel of a gun, and strikebreakers. Miners were forced out of the homes they were renting from the coal companies, and put into camps supported by the newly formed United Mine Workers Union. The situation escalated when strikebreaker agents provoked the miners, which in turn, caused the union to retaliate by supplying miners with high powered weapons, and ammunition. On September 1st, 1912, 6,000 miners set out with intent to kill the strikebreakers, and destroy company equipment. The Governor proclaimed martial law, and seized many of the miners' weapons. However, this did nothing to solve the problem. Resentment festered within the mining community. On May 19th, 1920, a massive insurrection rose up, not seen since the beginning of the Civil War. One decisive battle was fought in Logan County, which consisted of 10,000 miners against 3,000 strikebreakers and lawmen. The president of the United States sent in the army, and several bombers to destroy the miners. After a bloody, and grueling exchange, the miners were routed by the US Army. A victory for the US military, and a defeat for an already alienated mining guild. Mining companies celebrated, as union membership fell to all time lows. It was however, a pyrrhic victory for the mining companies. Company owners had succeeded in keeping miners in 'their place,' but public support would gradually increase against the mining companies. Just like the Alamo, the spirit of the miners was not destroyed, but only gave them a louder voice to be heard by the general public. Franklin D Roosevelt would later sign the New Deal, fully recognizing the United Mine Workers Union, which allowed workers of the time, to mine safer, and receive better pay."

 #####Flavor for Wyoming
 flavorWYO.1t:0 "Johnson County War"
 flavorWYO.1d:0 "The Johnson County War was a dispute fought between the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, and a posse of men made up of homesteaders, and farmers. The Wyoming Stock Growers Association, or WSGA was originally started to organize the cattle industry. However, any sense of strict business quickly went down the pipe as it sought to establish itself as the political strongarm of Wyoming. As more and more people began to settle west, wealthy, well established cattle ranchers saw them as a threat to their money and resources. Normally, cattle was allowed to roam free in lands belonging to the government. But seeing an opportunity, members of the WSGA bought up this land from the government, and forbade anyone from using it. But this was only the start. After a brutal summer and winter cycle, resources became very scarce. The WSGA began aggressively trying to remove other farmers and ranchers from their lands. Some acts involved setting fire to their homes, or stealing their cattle even though it was illegal to do so. WSGA bribed the local politicians into passing law which mandated all unbranded cattle in open range automatically became property of WSGA. Even to this point, the WSGA was not satisfied. They began to bribe, and hire anyone who would do their dirty work for them. Innocent men and women who were accused of cattle rustling could, and would be hung without trial. This was, however, not without repercussion. People who were not aligned with WSGA saw the corruption, and saw what the elite's wrongdoing going by unpunished. But any amount of opposition to the WSGA was met with relentless bloodshed. Finally, the public had had enough, and a local soon to be hero named Nate Champion became the backbone of the resistance toward WSGA. Forming the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Grower's Association, or NWFSGA, Champion spearheaded a direct economic competition with WSGA. WSGA immediately ordered Champion to break up the organization. When he refused, WSGA sent assassins to murder Champion in his sleep. The assassination attempt was a disaster for WSGA. Champion was able repel the attack, which only strengthened public morale for the man, and for the cause against WSGA. It was at this point, that hostility on both sides had reached its peak levels. The talk of war was in the air and on the newspapers. Politicians began choosing sides, and the WSGA began to arm itself to destroy their opposition, and anyone tied to the NWFSGA. In March of 1982, 50 men were hired from across the country by WSGA to exterminate the homesteaders. Their first target was Nate Champion. After surrounding his house, they then set fire to it, gunning him down mercilessly as he fled. But the bloodshed did not end there. They began to rampage through the land, to show their force and prove to the citizens of Wyoming that WSGA was in charge. In response, a force of 200 men were organized to put down the WSGA regiment. Outnumbered, the WSGA outlaws took cover inside a barn. For the next two days, a grueling gunfight took place. 20 of the 50 WSGA men tried to escape from the barn, but 5 were killed in the attempt, with the others retreating back to the barn, save for one who ran to the corrupt governor of Wyoming for help. The governor sent a frantic message to the president asking for military assistance, with seemingly little regard to his old allies. The US Cavalry arrived just as the sheriff and his posse were about to blow up the barn. The WSGA men were arrested, and then later set free of all charges. The state would continue to see corruption like this until 1883 when presumably, by political pressure of a newly elected government, the WSGA was forced to revoke its monopoly and open the organization to all people equally."

Either way, every year there are farmers unable to pay their bills, and taxes. Bankers are buying up lands left, and right. Some are honest folk, but many others care nothing for this nation or its people. Consequently, we are now finding that much of the land in this nation is now owned by private banks, with much political power. We can try to wrestle away the land from their grasp, but this will alienate the bankers, and it may lead to stability issues down the road from subversive elements. Another option is to lower the tax burden on farmers, and try to incentives businesses such as insurance companies, but this may lower our control over the nation, and increase autonomy in our provinces to some degree. Yet another option is to simply give in to the bankers... for a price."
