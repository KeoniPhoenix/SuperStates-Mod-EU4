However, we have adopted a method of farming akin to American ranching, where the landowner is granted Crown lands on which to raise his cattle and horses.

The unfamiliar nature of our wildlife and geography makes Australia deadly for invading armies.

Our overlord demanded that we surrender most of the riches accumulated from mining our gold, but we were having none of that nonsense! It was this rebellion that birthed the Eureka Flag, and although this rebellion failed, we now finally stand as an independent nation, and nobody will take Australian gold but Australians!"

 AUS_bushrangers_desc:0 "A sizeable number of settlers sent from the mainland to live in Australia were convicts and undesirables forced into exile, and the particularly cunning amongst these thieves and cutthroats would become Bushrangers. These were hardened men who used the unforgiving Australian bush as a base for their robbing operations. They were particularly rich and powerful during the Australian Gold Rush, but now that we have won our freedom for our colonial oppressors, these men are convicts to no-one, and we would do well to utilise their ambushing tactics on our enemies!"

It tells the story of an escaped convict stealing a sheep and dying in his fight against the law. For we in Australia, it is not the glory of victory, but the honour of the struggle that defines who we are!"
