It is clear that at this time, the bureaucrats are strongly in favor of reducing local powers, and increasing the responsibility of the central government. The theocracy stands opposed to removing local power, fearing that one immoral ruler could destroy the principles of the nation, and by in part, who we are.

But at times, it may become interested in securing nearby provinces, and destabilizing our enemies. The faction feels it is time for us to expand our influence in the region by force.

The material could be considered damaging, because it provides clear evidence of misconduct among these leaders. Bureaucrats are asking the state to destroy any, and all material damaging to the central government, and our way of governing, while severely punishing those who publish it. The Theocrats accuse the Bureaucrats of trying to cover up truth, and should be punished themselves. Insults have been exchanged both ways, and the court is in deadlock over the matter."

Several locations have been determinted to be prime real estate to expand the nation's industry by the Plutocrats, and they are preapred to offer a great sum of money to appropriate the land. Theocrats believe that this is akin to stealing, and that any aquisition of land by the government should be dealt just like any regular private transaction.

Distributing fishing rods, hunting knives, and almanacs on basic economics would stimulate the economy, according to one of the top businessman reporting in our court. However, Bureaucrats state this would directly threaten the country.
