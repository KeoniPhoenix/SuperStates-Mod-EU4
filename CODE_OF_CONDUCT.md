# Code of Conduct #

1. This is a relaxed project, there generally are no deadlines and therefore there is no need to stress.

2. Unproductive and unnecessary political or personal arguments could be viewed as detrimental to the project and should be avoided.

3. Political subjects that are considered controversial are to be avoided and if deemed excessive, warnings could be issued.  If warnings are not respected, temporary or permanent removal from the project could be a possible outcome. 

4. Harassment of any form is not tolerated and contributers are expected to be upstanding between one another.

5. Votes might be required to resolve disputes on choices made for the mod project, and generally the Mod Development Leader votes has somewhat more weight than others, however that does not imply favoritism towards one side or the other.

6. All members of the mod project must own or lease a legitimate copy of Europa Universalis IV. Not having a legal copy of the game will result in expulsion from the mod project.

7. Personal behaivor outside of the mod project could be used against a person if it is deemed detrimental to the mod project or brings liability to the Mod team in any way.

8. Warnings are to be issued if there are any problems deemed detrimental to the project, failure to abide by the warnings can result in a temporary or permanent explsion from the mod project.

9. Explusions that are temporary will only last for the period they are set for and may be extended or shortened depending on behavior or the circumstances by appeal.

10. Appeals after explusion are handled by the Mod Development Lead, appeals that are final.  Disputing an appeal will result in immediate permanent explusion without an appeal.

11. Expulsion from the Mod project includes the revocation of any privileges in the Mod project on GitHub or on the mod project Discord Server.  Bans from the Discord Server are seperate from GitHub, however circumstances may necessiate both simultaneously.
